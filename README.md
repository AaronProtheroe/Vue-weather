# Vue weather app

This is a simple weather app that I created using the Vuejs framework. The works by the user simply 
typing the name of a city into the search bar and then clicking the search button. A card will then
appear display certain meteorlogical details for the city that the user searches.

# How to run

To run this program, make sure you have npm installed on your machine. Then simply navigate into the projects
directory and run the command 'npm run serve'. Wait for the server to start and then simply go to 'localhost:8080'
in your web browser and use the app.

# How the app gets its data

This project was created to show my understanding of using third party api's. This project uses openweather api
to fetch the data. The program will fetch the necessary data from the openweather servers by using the city name
that the user inputs. It will then display the details of the current weather in that city.
